 A novel multimodal Neuromarketing dataset that encompasses the data from 42 individuals who participated in an advertising brochure-browsing scenario is introduced here. In more detail, participants were exposed to a series of supermarket brochures (containing various products) and instructed to select the products they intended to buy. The data collected for each individual executing this protocol included: (i) encephalographic (EEG) recordings, (ii) eye tracking (ET) recordings, (iii) questionnaire responses (demographic, profiling and product related questions), and (iv) computer mouse data.
